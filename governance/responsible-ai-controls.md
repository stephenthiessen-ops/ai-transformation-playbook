# Responsible AI Controls Framework

## 1. Data Boundary Controls
- No PII into public models
- Approved dataset registry
- Redaction layer

## 2. Prompt Versioning
- All production prompts version-controlled
- Change history tracked

## 3. Human-in-the-Loop
- AI outputs reviewed before high-impact decisions
- Escalation path defined

## 4. Auditability
- Input snapshot archived
- Output traceable to model + prompt version

## 5. Risk Classification
- Low Risk (internal summarization)
- Moderate Risk (analysis)
- High Risk (external-facing decisions)
