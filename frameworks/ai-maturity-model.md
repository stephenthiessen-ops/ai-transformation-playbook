# AI Maturity Model (0–5)

A practical assessment framework for evaluating AI adoption across technology, governance, and organizational readiness.

---

## Level 0 — Reactive Experimentation
- Ad-hoc AI usage
- No centralized governance
- Tool sprawl
- No measurement of outcomes

Risk: Shadow AI, compliance exposure, wasted spend

---

## Level 1 — Isolated Pilots
- AI pilots within specific teams
- Limited integration into core workflows
- Informal guardrails

Risk: Pilot fatigue, low adoption

---

## Level 2 — Structured Enablement
- Defined AI tool stack
- Prompt libraries / agent catalog
- Initial governance policies
- Measured use cases

Outcome: Early ROI visibility

---

## Level 3 — Operational Integration
- AI embedded in execution workflows (Jira, BI, DevOps)
- Deterministic data layer feeding AI systems
- Formal risk review process
- Portfolio-level metrics

Outcome: AI reduces cognitive load and accelerates decision-making

---

## Level 4 — Strategic Augmentation
- AI drives planning, forecasting, risk modeling
- Automated intelligence loops
- Executive dashboards powered by AI interpretation
- AI Center of Excellence or Platform team

Outcome: Measurable operating leverage

---

## Level 5 — AI-Native Enterprise
- AI embedded into operating model
- Continuous optimization loop
- Governance automated and versioned
- AI-driven resource allocation insights

Outcome: Competitive advantage via adaptive systems
